# REVIUNG 41
here is the official reviung41 parts list/project repo - attached below are links to make your search faster/easier.
https://github.com/gtips/reviung/tree/master/reviung41
## pcb or pcb/plates
    https://www.etsy.com/listing/1286963483/reviung41-keyboard-pcb?variation0=4478893766
alternatively, you could get pcb's fabricated for yourself, but it'll prob be more expensive bc of shipping, and minimum order quantity is usually 5 pcb's.

## switches
most likely the cheapest option, also incredible switches. doubly incredible after lubing them.
    https://kbdfans.com/products/gateron-milky-housing-yellow-linear-switches
good place to branch out after/if you don't want to take the effort to lube switches by hand - i can personally reccomend the matchas and the ocean blue tactile switches.

# keycaps
literally just search aliexpress or amazon or ebay for "keycaps" but if you need to go absolutely maximum budget, these exist lol

i would reeeeeeaaaaallly recommend searching for something pbt at least, if not doubleshot pbt. If there's a semi-popular GMK keycap set you like, there is moooost likely a ~$20 set of clone keycaps that are reasonably well made out there.

examples - 
~$10 clones

which diodes you need depends on the pcb you end up with, thru hold is easier tho by far. you'll need 41.

screws and standoffs - 
	usually these are m2 , i know that's the case on the reviung41
2u mx stabilizer, i think rev41 needs a clip-in one
	https://www.amazon.com/DUROCK-Stabilizer-Keyboard-Stabilizers-Compatible/dp/B0CRRHP9MY/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&sr=1-2 
	durock makes good stabilizers, if you want the spacebar to feel godly you can use one of these and mod it, but you can also just source one for around $2 on aliexpress. just search for "2U mx clip in stabilizer" Strictly speaking though, you don't reeeally need one of these to get the build working! it just might feel kinda wonky.
Also, if you are buying gateron yellows on KBDfans (which, you really probably should, for price reasons and that they're incredible switches regardless of budget) kbdfans will also sell you 2u stabilizers, so to save shipping it probably makes sense to knock that out on kbdfans too.

or, splitkb.com if you have smth else coming from there -

i would also get some kind of rubber feet - 
	https://splitkb.com/products/skuf-silicone-rubber-feet?_pos=1&_sid=28ed1ec41&_ss=r
	on splitkb, but i'd probably reccommend getting a few of the kind that are basically just little dots

		or another one you might be able to find cheaper, though 3m ones if you can find them will stay on forever
## accessories/QOL
detachable magnetic cable, i'd call it a necessity for micro usb controllers. not bc they're expensive to replace, but bc it's a pain in the ass to solder 24 pins again, even if it's socketed for faster replacement
	https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08RC8TV2H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1
        idk about eu retailers but try ebay, this brand makes great ones, they're what i personally use. though, they look like generic ones with a brand pasted on, so maybe try aliexpress too lol, though it is important that you get a kind that will do data transfer and not just power.
MCU sockets
        https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0778TFL39/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1
	alternatively, for an EU source for this, splitkb.com - 
		https://splitkb.com/products/mill-max-low-profile-sockets?variant=31945995812941
	i will say though, it's really worth buying a lot more of those sockets if you have any interest at all in making custom hardware, bc of how much less work it makes starting the next handwire build lol
        these are not *strictly* necessary but, they are a real life saver lol
	        the reason that you want these is that once you solder the delicate tiny pins into the MCU, every successive board you build either w a pcb or handwired means that you get to solder in sockets which are rigidly held together, and vastly easier to work with.
			it also means that you can move the same MCU from board to board, and don't have to buy new ones every time you want to build a new keyboard, you just use a few more of the socket pieces. this becomes especially important if you ever want a wireless board and buy a nice!nano v2 (which, i can attest, are incredibly nice, but they are also not cheap.)
# other notes
- if you eventually go down the rabbithole of making custom stuff, you can get bluetooth functionality for much cheaper - the XIAO BLE board is super cheap, it just doesn't have a footprint that will work on most pcb's, with very few rare exceptions (most QMK boards are developed on the arduino pro micro platform, which is ATMEGA32u4, so if you get one of those  it will usually work for anything you want to use, pcb or not
	- https://www.amazon.com/Microcontroller-Dual-Core-MicroPython-CircuitPython-Interfaces/dp/B09NNVNW7M for the xiao BLE/so you know what to look for when tracking one down in the EU if you are interested.
